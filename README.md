# Anno Mods Collection

My own collection of Anno 1800 mods I like.

They are organized by creators because most of them come from big collections (Spice it up, Taludas, Jakob etc...).

The last mods, tagged with [z], are standalone mods.

## Usage 
Add the mods to `Anno 1800/mods` folder, or use [I Mod Your Anno](https://github.com/anno-mods/iModYourAnno), you can import latest release in the "Library" tab by clicking "Select Archive to install" 

Note: this collection is not intended to be runned like that, it's just a place where I store the mods I like, I never use all of them in a single session !
